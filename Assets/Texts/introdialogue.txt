Healer, finally! I hope you come well prepared for the journey ahead. The future looks bleaker by the hour.

I come from the camp. It is dangerous yes, but I had to visit them. The strange sickness has claimed four new victims and clutched its claws on a dozen more. I fear to speak of tomorrowâ€¦ unless you can find the ingredients for a cure. 

One more thing before you go. Our shaman, she had another omen about this cave. Though it promises the richest harvest of the precious healing herbs, there is also something darker lurking within its depths. Underneath, these meadows conceal an ugliness unseemly to their abundance.

Our time runs out. Whatever happens, stay true to your oath, Healer.
