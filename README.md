DESCRIPTION:

Dungeon Medicine (Anoroc, 2020) is a top-down 2D fantasy game of speed, adventure, combat and tough choices.
As the tribe’s Healer, the duty falls heavy on your shoulders upon an hour when your people are ravaged by
a lethal sickness. Racing against the clock and fighting wicked monsters, you must clear a level after level
of dungeon environment in order to gather the raw ingredients for and concoct a cure that will decide the fate
of all you know and hold dear. Are you ready to bear the weight of the plague mask? Will you be the healer the
tribe needs, deserves, or shuns…
